* [dotnet new](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) creates an application. This command generates the files and assets necessary for your application. The introduction to C# tutorials all use the console application type. Once you've got the basics, you can expand to other application types.
  * `dotnet new console -o myApp`
* `dotnet build` builds the executable.
* `dotnet run` runs the executable.
